# api-clients

This package contains the API clients generated by [api-client-generator](https://gitlab.com/zapier/team-developer-experience/api-client-generator). See the generator docs for more information on how to utilise the clients, add a new client, or better understand it's usage.

## What does this do? 
This package automates the process of generating TypeScript type definitions and client code from OpenAPI specifications. It essentially:
* Pulls OpenAPI specifications from other Zapier services (like Chatbots, Interfaces, Tables, Canvas, Zaps) defined in apis.json
* Generates TypeScript types and client code from these specifications
* Keeps these types in sync (as long as you run the pnpm run api-clients:update command)

## Removing this package
* Delete the packages/api-clients directory
* Remove the reference to `"@zapier/api-client-generator": "0.3.3"` in the package.json and regenerate the pnpm-lock.yaml file.
